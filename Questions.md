How do you plan to make your game engaging? 
I will have 6 levels in this and give a passcode for the next level at the end of each level and I will add imun in this game which actully will act like your score and by touching every protective thing(mask, sanitizer etc...)
The imun will increase by a certain level and if the player loses a level he can restart from the same level as he knows the passcode.
